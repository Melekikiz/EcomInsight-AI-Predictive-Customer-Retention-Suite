## 🎯 The Objective
In the competitive e-commerce landscape, acquiring a new customer is **5x more expensive** than retaining an existing one. This project provides:
* **Proactive Risk Detection:** Identify "at-risk" customers using high-precision Machine Learning.
* **Financial Quantification:** Calculate the **Estimated Recovery Value (ERV)** to prioritize high-value retention efforts.
* **Strategic Actionability:** Provide data-backed "Retention Windows" and suggested marketing strategies.
* **Transparency (XAI):** Move beyond "Black Box" models by using SHAP to explain exactly why a customer is flagged.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-Time Scoring:** FastAPI-powered backend providing churn probabilities in sub-200ms.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrated SHAP visualizations for feature importance and model transparency.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Automated K-Means clustering (Champions, Loyalists, At-Risk).
* **Strategic Business Metrics:** Automated calculation of potential revenue loss and recovery plans.
* **Interactive UI:** A modern, dark-themed dashboard built with Streamlit for high-level business intelligence.
